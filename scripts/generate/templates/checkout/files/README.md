# Checkout extension

This directory contains your new checkout extension. A small, example extension is already written for you in the `src/index` file. You can start working on your extension by [running the local development server](TODO) and editing `src/index`. You’ll also want to check out the [API documentation](TODO) to see what components and data your extension has access to.

Once you’re ready to view this extension on a real store, you can follow the instructions for [deploying your extension](TODO).
