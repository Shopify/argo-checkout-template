# Post-purchase app extension

Checkout extensions allow developers to extend and customize Shopify's checkout.

With a post-purchase app extension, you can customize the experience that customers go through after completing a checkout.
For example, you can cross-sell other products, show a survey, and much more.

## Getting started

The code in this folder was created automatically to give you a starting point.

Post-purchase app extensions are not yet available to the general partner community.
When they become available, you will have documentation and tutorials to guide you through the development process.
Until then, you can jump right into the code in the `./src` folder.
